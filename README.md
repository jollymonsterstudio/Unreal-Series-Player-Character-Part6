# Unreal C++ Tutorial 
### Player Character Series – Punch – Part 6 - Review using Kicks !

Hey guys,

This is the sixth video in our Player Character.

This time we are going to do a review lesson where we go back over all the topics we covered earlier and use them to implement a new set of attacks in the form of kicks.

The major component that is net new to this series is the inclusion of an [additional Blend Node](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Engine/Animation/NodeReference/Blend) which you can [read about here](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Engine/Animation/NodeReference/Blend#blendposesbybool).

Take a look and we will see you next time.

Hope this helps, Thanks.
